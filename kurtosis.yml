  -------------
  - Basic understanding of Cosmos/Coreum blockchain architecture
  - Knowledge of validator and node configuration parameters

  Configuration

  - `chains`: Configuration for each blockchain
    - `name`: Chain name (e.g., "coreum", "gaia")
    - `chain_id`: Unique identifier for the chain
    - `denom`: Token denomination configuration (name, display, symbol, units)
    - `participants`: Validator and node configuration
  - `connections`: IBC connections between chains (for multi-chain setups)
  - `services`: Additional services to deploy
    - `bdjuno`: Block explorer configuration
    - `prometheus/grafana`: Monitoring stack settings
